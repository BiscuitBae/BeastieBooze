# BeastieBooze

Webpack:
BeastieBooze's react components are bundled/compiled using webpack and babel. The configuration for webpack can be found at webpack.config.js while the babel presets are located at .babelrc. The command to run webpack is <npm run build:dev>. This command must be run throughout dev to contiguously package any changes that will render on the client side.
