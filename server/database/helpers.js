// for the oauth to work i need 2 functions here
// getUser and createUser
// needs to be exported for use in passport-setup.js

// getUser should take a userId and return the found user, empty array or null if not found?

// createUser should take a user object ({ googleId, username, email }) which should make a new user entry in the db
